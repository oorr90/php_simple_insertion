# PHP Insert - Cafe Order Form

Using an insert query and connecting to mysql

## Getting Started

I used MAMP and my local server to test this project. Download the project files and insert your own databse connection details instead of the placeholders (line 26 - 29 in cafe_insert.php)

### Images

Images below show the table structure in mySQL as well as the table after insertion
